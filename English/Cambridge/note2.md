**SHE SAID YES ! ! !** SATURDAY, APRIL 28

What a crazy week! I forgot Sophie's birthday. I got a new job. Oh, and I **almost didn't** ask Sophie to
marry me!

I bought a ring for Sophie on Saturday morning - I wanted to ask her to marry me that night. So I invited her over, cooked a special dinner, and made her favorite dessert. I felt nervous, but when she arrived, she said she had a cold and felt tired. Not the right mood for "Marry me." She went straight home after dinner. She didn't even eat my chocolate cake!

I had an important interview on Wednesday - I didn't get Sophie's cold, thank goodness - and I got the
job! When I **texted Sophie the good news**, she **texted back**, "Let's have dinner on Friday to celebrate!"
Perfect, right? Wrong. We went to our favorite restaurant. Before the server **showed us to our table**, Sophie saw some friends, and we all ate together. I didn't want to **ask her** in front of all our friends.
After we left the restaurant, Sophie borrowed my jacket. (Oh, no! The ring!) She put her hands in the
pockets and found the box!

"Oh, you remembered my birthday!" she said. (Oh, no! Her birthday!) Then she opened the box.
**Thinking fast**, I **dropped to one knee**. "Happy birthday, Sophie! Will you marry me?"

**A "Thank Goodness It's Friday" Party**

Last Friday, I met a friend for coffee **after** work. We usually go out on Fridays, but we wanted to do something different. We felt exhausted, and we wanted to relax a little! **Before** we left the coffee shop, we
called four friends. We invited them to my apartment for a little party.**Then** we stopped at a supermarket and bought some sodas and three big pizzas. **When** our friends arrived, we **just** sat and talked **for hours**. And we ate all three pizzas! We had a really great time!

【The College Post】: Do you remember your first job?
【Melissa King】: Yeah. I had a part-time job in a restaurant. I was a server. I was young - only 16. I remember that on my first day things were really busy, and I was very nervous. I made a lot of embarrassing mistakes, and my boss wasn't too pleased.

【Melissa King】: Yes, they were - **I guess** because I was new.

#### 4. A funny thing happened ...

Our **community**: This week 一 funny stories from our readers

**How embarrassing!**
By Sarah Morgan

A funny thing **happened to me** yesterday after work. I was really hungry and I didn't **feel like** making dinner, so I went to a fast food place near my office building. I got a cheeseburger, some fries, and a soda. The restaurant was really crowded, so **I had to share a table**. I sat down **with** my tray **across** from a young
guy. I said,“Hi. **Is this seat free**?" He nodded and smiled, but he didn't say anything. He seemed pretty nice.

Anyway, I got out a magazine and started eating my burger. It was a really interesting article and I **couldn't stop** reading. But then I saw the guy take one of my fries! I couldn't believe it, but I **was too embarrassed to say** anything. Then he took another one, and I still didn't say anything!

Then I thought, "Those are my fries." So I **took a handful** and ate them. The guy looked at me in a funny way, but he didn't say anything. Then he did it again and ate another one of my fries! It was really strange.

Finally, **a few minutes later**, he got up, took his tray, and left. **That's when** I realized the fries were on his
tray! And my fries? They were under my magazine. How embarrassing! I ran out into the street. There was the guy.

I said,"Hi. We met a few minutes ago."
He said, "yeah, we did."
I said, "I think I ate your fries."
He laughed and said, "yes, you did."
I apologized and said, "I thought they were my fries."
He said, "that's OK. No problem."
I said, "can I buy some more fries for you."
He laughed and said, "thank you I'm still a little hungry."

Juan's on a diet. He can't eat much rice, bread, or **pasta**. But he eats a lot of meat, cheese, eggs, and vegetables, like carrots and **cucumbers**.

And David is **picky**- I mean, he doesn't eat many vegetables. And he's **allergic** to milk and **shellfish**. But he likes potatoes. Oh, and bananas. Please call me! Bye.

We searched the world and found these unusual places to eat.

**Chillout ice restaurant, Dubai**
Would you like to visit a really cool restaurant? Then try this place. Everything **is made of ice**, **from the tables and chairs to the pictures on the walls**. When you order a soda, it comes in an ice glass. and
your meal **is served** on an ice plate. Luckily, if you get too cold, you can ask for a warm **blanket** and some hot chocolate. **Be sure to** try some ice cream, too. It never melts!

You and 21 guests can enjoy dinner at a table **hanging in the air**! A chef, a server, and an entertainer go with you to make a perfect evening.

**The Hajime Robot Restaurant, Bangkok**
Here's something really different - a restaurant with robots. Choose your food from a **touchscreen** computer menu, and a few minutes later, a **smiling** robot brings it to you. You can also barbecue food at your table or order other delicious Asian dishes from the menu. Try a **green tea smoothie** and then sit back and enjoy the entertainment - every hour the robots **dance to** music! It's a fun and lively atmosphere, and the service is excellent!
