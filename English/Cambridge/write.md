**Exergaming ! Put it down**

Recent years, exergaming  is becoming more and more popular. People of all ages ski , play golf , do karate and more in the virtual world made by exergaming.  Some people claim it's a convenient, cheap, and fun way to exercise, but I disagree. 

> 

Firstly, it's true that exergaming  is convenient. You needn't care about the weather, but you have to remember you have family and neighbours. If you were sleeping in the morning, you couldn't stand  your couple  is playing and making some noise.

> spouse 

Secondly, healthy body maybe, bad eyes guaranteed. If you want to exercise one hour by exergaming   , you will stare at the screen one hours.  And exercise all day, stare at screen all day. At present, exercise outdoor is playing an important role that makes children puts cell phones down , goes outside, breathes fresh air and gets natural light. 



The last and most important problem is that playing exergaming in virtual world can not give you experience which you exercise in the real world as usual. There is no the sun and rain, cheers  and tears,  cooperation and competition in the world of exergaming . But all of them is necessary component and unique charm of real exercise. Yao Ming put his sport career end at 30 years old , the best age, because of injury. It's sad. At the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games ,  Su Bingtian became the first yellow race , which run 100 meters in 9.83 seconds. At that time, he have been 32.  The 35-year-old Messi finally won the World Cup with help from teammates in 2022. It was her last  World Cup.  As the most gifted football sporter,  he had taken part in the World Cup four times but never ever took  the World Cup back for Argentina. So they hugged together and cried for celebrating the first  victory in the last 20 years. In the other side of football field, France team also hugged together and cried. They lost this match, although they also took four years for this match. Let's focus on life of the general. In a student sport meeting, a girl was encouraging never give up , which she is running in 3000 metres match.  Her body is telling her : " you have been tired"  and her mind tell her: " you have l lost the game ".  But heart tell her ：" Finishing is more important than winning. "  Her friends tell her : " Surpassing self  is more meaningful than surpassing others."



It is meaning of real exercise. Only in real world, we can experience change our body as human rather than machine.  Our body become strong , injured , weak, decay as age increase. All of them give exercise meaning that exercise help us to surpass self and teach us face our limit in the same time. We can get these by playing exergaming.  Put  exergaming down, and enjoy the real world. 

#### 9. Homework: A Typical Day

When I wake in the morning, My first thing is to use WeChat to read article and news.
Until 8 a.m, I realise I must get up and go to work, or I'll be late. I must get to company before 8:30 a.m.
Fortunately, I live around my company. It's take me about 10 minutes to get to my company from my home by bike.
I have to clock in by 8:30 a.m, but Actually my work start at 9 a.m. So when I get to company, I still have 30  minutes to enjoy my breakfast.
I am a coder, but my work isn't hard at all and even easy. I don't have a lot of things to do in  most of the time.
In the morning I take much time to check my stock. In fact , I also code when my boss notice I is playing phone.

In the noon, I usually go home to relax. I open the door , lie down the bed and analyse future of the company that I buy in the stock market.
But no useful. It's so sad.

Ih the afternoon, I really start to write code.

After work, at 5:30 p.m, I go home and lie down the bed. In the beginning, I just want to relax for a while.
So I start to watch  short video by BiliBili. I should have learned English at that time in my schedule.
However,to bo honest, the girl dancing in the short video is more attractive than teacher teaching in long video.
After two hours, I start learning English.
